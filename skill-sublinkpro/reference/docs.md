# SublinkPro Documentation Map (online manual)

This turns the skill into an **online instruction manual** for SublinkPro: when the
user asks *how something works*, *how to configure it*, *what a feature does*, or
*how to operate the project itself* (not a live API call), the agent answers from
the project's official docs.

**The docs are NOT bundled into this skill.** They live in the GitHub repo and are
fetched on demand, so answers always reflect the current published documentation.
Use your web-fetch capability to read the relevant file, then answer in the user's
language — summarize and quote the doc, don't invent details.

## How to use this map

1. Match the user's question to a topic in the table below.
2. Fetch that doc's raw URL (see URL pattern). Prefer the language matching the
   user's question: Chinese → the `*.zh-CN.md` variant; English → the base `.md`.
3. Read it and answer. If the answer spans multiple docs, fetch each as needed.
4. Cite the human-readable GitHub page (the `blob` URL) so the user can open it too.
5. If you can't fetch (offline / no web access), tell the user and give them the
   GitHub link to read it themselves — never fabricate the content.

## URL patterns

- **Raw (fetch this to read content):**
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeroDeng01/sublinkPro/main/<path>`
- **Human page (give this to the user):**
  `https://github.com/ZeroDeng01/sublinkPro/blob/main/<path>`
- **Repo root:** `https://github.com/ZeroDeng01/sublinkPro`

Every doc is maintained in **both languages**: English at `<path>.md`, Simplified
Chinese at the same path with a `.zh-CN.md` suffix (e.g. `docs/installation.md` →
`docs/installation.zh-CN.md`). The table lists the English `<path>`; swap the
suffix for Chinese.

## Topic → document map

### Overview & getting started
| User asks about | Doc path (`<path>`) |
|---|---|
| What the project is, feature overview, quick start, screenshots | `README.md` |
| (Chinese project overview) | `README.zh-CN.md` |

### Install, configure, deploy
| User asks about | Doc path |
|---|---|
| Install methods (Docker, docker-compose, one-line script), updates, Watchtower auto-update | `docs/installation.md` |
| Environment variables, command-line flags, config precedence, CAPTCHA modes | `docs/configuration.md` |
| Build process, production build, Docker build, CI/CD, troubleshooting | `docs/build-and-deployment.md` |
| Security best practices, default credentials, sensitive config, MFA, Docker security | `docs/security-guidelines.md` |

> For deploying *through the skill* (guided, conversational), also see this skill's
> own `reference/deploy.md`. Use `docs/installation.md` + `docs/configuration.md`
> when the user wants to read the canonical project documentation.

## Notes & guardrails

- This map lists every doc that existed when written. If a fetch 404s, the doc may
  have been renamed/moved — fall back to the repo root or `README.md`'s
  Documentation index (`https://github.com/ZeroDeng01/sublinkPro#-documentation`)
  to find the current path, and tell the user it moved. Don't guess a new path.
- These docs describe the **project** (install, features, configuration). For
  *operating a live instance* via the REST API, use `reference/api.md`. For
  *deploying* an instance step by step, use `reference/deploy.md`.
- Always answer in the user's language; fetch the matching language variant when
  available.
